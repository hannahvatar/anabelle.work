        <h3>Role and Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>This e-commerce project demonstrates my full-stack development capabilities, marking the successful application of my coding skills after completing my web development program. While I handled all aspects of UX/UI and merchandise design, the primary focus was on technical implementation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Frontend Development: HTML5, CSS3/SCSS, JavaScript, Web Accessibility (WCAG)</li>
              <li>Backend Development: Ruby, Ruby on Rails</li>
              <li>Database Management: PostgreSQL</li>
              <li>API Integrations: Printify, OpenAI, Stripe Payment Gateway</li>
              <li>Version Control: Git/GitHub</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
            <p>It took me two weeks after graduation in December 2024</p>
          <h3>Team Structure</h3>
            <p>Solo project - designed and developed entirely by myself.</p>
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <h3>Problem To Solve</h3>
            <p>In a tech landscape dominated by men and growing AI concerns, this project aims to inspire women to embrace and master technology rather than fear it.</p>
          <h3>Business Goals</h3>
            <p>Wobot is an e-commerce art project featuring a statement sweater, prioritizing social impact and technical demonstration over commercial profitability.</p>
          <h3>User Goals</h3>
            <p>The site empowers women in tech through its message-driven merchandise, while an integrated AI chatbot adds a playful element by generating lighthearted predictions about technology's future.</p>
       <h2>Research & Insights</h2>
          <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>The realization that "being a woman" qualified me for tech Diversity Scholarship programs sparked my interest in researching gender disparity in tech. Through secondary research, I gained insights into the persistent gender gap in the technology sector.</p>
          <h3>Persona</h3>
            <p>A woman in tech often finds herself navigating a male-dominated industry where she must continuously prove her capabilities. Despite her qualifications, she frequently encounters assumptions about her technical abilities and may feel pressure to work harder for the same recognition. She seeks ways to assert her presence and values connecting with others who share similar experiences in the field.</p>
          <h3>Key Insights</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Women hold 26.7% of technology-related jobs (2023)</li>
              <li>Only 28% of startups include at least one female founder (2023)</li>
              <li>Women occupy just 24% of leadership positions in tech (2023)</li>
              <li>Women in tech earn approximately 83 cents for every dollar earned by men in similar positions</li>
              <li>The gap widens at senior levels, where women earn up to 93% less than male counterparts</li>
              <li>Tech jobs are growing 3x faster than non-tech jobs</li>
              <li>Organizations with women in leadership roles see 34% higher returns</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Sources: These statistics are compiled from organizations like UNESCO, National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT), and industry reports from 2021-2023.</p>

       <h2>Ideation and Strategy</h2>
          <h3>Brainstorming and Ideation</h3>
            <p>After encountering the phrase 'Girls who code write their future,' which aims to encourage young girls into tech, I adapted it to 'Women who code write their future' to emphasize that it's never too late to enter the field, especially as technology becomes increasingly crucial across all industries.</p>
          <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
          <h3>Design Principles</h3>
            <p>The design approach emphasizes a minimalist, clean interface that keeps the focus on the empowering message and product. Strong typography and purposeful color choices showcase strong design aesthetic skills, while a straightforward navigation ensures a frictionless purchase process. The site maintains user trust through secure payment integration (Stripe), with responsive design ensuring seamless access across all devices. A playful AI chatbot adds an engaging element while maintaining the simplicity of the core shopping experience.</p>
