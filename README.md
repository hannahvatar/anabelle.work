# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸŽ‰ This is where I showcase my skills, projects, and the unique journey that shaped me into the Product Designer and developer I am today. Oh, and fun factâ€”I fully coded this site myself. ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸš€ About This Project

This portfolio is built to highlight my expertise in:
- **Product Design**: From wireframes to high-fidelity mockups.
- **Design Systems**: A love for tokens and scalable, efficient design.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Yes, I code tooâ€”HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even Rails!

Whether you're here to explore my work, collaborate, or just check out some cool designs, you're in the right place.

Hereâ€™s the stack that powers this site:
- **HTML5** for semantic structure.
- **SCSS** for modular and maintainable styling.
