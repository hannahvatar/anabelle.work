    <div class="about-me-content">
      <div class="about-me-section">
        <p>My journey to becoming the <span class="highlight-pink">Seasoned Product Designer</span> I am today has been like building a product roadmap, with each milestone unlocking a new feature. It started in <span class="highlight-red">Business & Marketing</span>â€”think of it as the wireframe phase of my career, where I laid the foundation for the <span class="highlight-blue">data-oriented UX designer</span> I am today. Then I discovered <span class="highlight-orange">Graphic Design</span> and began shaping my ideas, one pixel at a time. Naturally, I leveled up to <span class="highlight-yellow">Web & Interactive Design</span>, where I could finally get things movin'. Enter <span class="highlight-green">Figma and Design Systems</span>â€”which sparked the geek in me and a newfound passion for tokens. As the insatiable dorky learner I am, I recently completed a <span class="highlight-violet">Full Stack Web Development & AI</span> certificate, because why stop at designing when you can code and optimize the whole product experience? Oh, and by the way, I fully coded this siteâ€”so I guess you could say Iâ€™m the full-stack designer... or a <strong>unicorn</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Desjardins B2E Design System</h2>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>A comprehensive design system tailored for Business-to-Employee (B2E) applications within the fintech sector. The design system serves as a centralized repository of standardized design components, guidelines, and principles, enabling consistent and efficient digital experiences across Desjardins' internal platforms.</p>
            <h4>Role and Responsibilities</h4>
              <p>As the Lead Designer, I was responsible for conceptualizing and developing the overarching design system strategy,
                  creating and maintaining design tokens, component libraries, documentation,
                  collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to ensure system-wide adoption,
                  driving design consistency and improving design efficiency and conducting design workshops and training sessions.</p>
            <h4>Project Timeline</h4>
              <p> Lead Designer for a 3-year duration</p>
            <h4>Team Structure</h4>
              <p>The design system comprised 20 hands-on B2E designers, with a core team of a Product Owner, Lead Designer (myself), UX Designer, UX Writer, and dedicated developers.</p>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <h4>Problem to Solve</h4>
            <p>The challenge was scaling from the Core Design System from customer-facing dot-com applications to B2E platforms, bridging technological differences between Adobe Experience Manager, web components, and Angular-based systems with distinct design needs.</p>
            <h4>Business Goals</h4>
            <p>Desjardins' business goals were fundamentally tied to optimizing application development and employee productivity. Given that a substantial portion of the company's revenues stems from interactions between customers and employees using these digital platforms, the design system became a critical strategic asset for operational efficiency and performance enhancement.</p>
            <h4>User Goals</h4>
            <p>From the user perspective, the primary goal was to enable employees to assist customers as seamlessly as possible, ultimately driving increased productivity and, consequently, sales. The design system needed to empower employees with intuitive, efficient tools that would reduce friction in their daily interactions and support high-quality customer service.</p>
        <h3>Research and Insights</h3>
            <h4>User Research</h4>
              <p>Conducted research at the Customer Relations Center (Centre de relations clients), providing direct opportunities to observe employees and perform usability testing. Desjardins' dedicated UX laboratory offered additional advanced research capabilities, enabling in-depth insights into employee interaction patterns and user experiences.</p>
            <h4>Persona</h4>
              <p>As a bank employee, one navigates a complex landscape of financial products and customer interactions. Day after day, the role demands moving between intricate computer systems, processing mortgages, evaluating loans, and providing personalized financial advice. This profession requires a keen eye for detail, the ability to quickly understand diverse financial situations, and the skill to seamlessly transition between multiple banking software platforms. More than just processing paperwork, the job is about being a financial guide, translating complex banking language into meaningful solutions for clients.</p>
            <h4>Key insights</h4>
              <p>Employees emerged as sophisticated "power users" who simultaneously navigated complex applications with remarkable agility. The design priorities centered on maximizing operational efficiency, reducing cognitive load, and streamlining task completion. Critical to success was an intuitive, high-performance user interface that supported rapid context-switching and minimized potential for error, ultimately enhancing overall workplace productivity</p>
        <h3>Ideation and Strategy</h3>
            <h4>Brainstorming and Ideation</h4>
              <p>Design alignment was achieved through weekly design reviews, where B2E designer teams collaborated to synchronize application approaches. Additionally, a weekly Design System Review meeting allowed teams to present ongoing sprint tasks and gather collective insights on component evolution and design system development and improvement</p>
            <h4>Design Principles</h4>
              <p>Design decisions were driven by a design thinking approach and user-centric methodologies. By leveraging Figma data analytics and user research insights, the team ensured a data-driven strategy for design system development, prioritizing empirical evidence and user experience in every design choice.</p>
        <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <h4>Wireframes and Prototyping</h4>
              <p>UX and UI designers collaborated in paired teams, with distinct yet complementary responsibilities. The UX designers focused on research, low-fidelity wireframes, storyboards, and initial prototypes to define the overall structural approach and documentation.</p>
            <h4>Visual & UI Design</h4>
              <p>Meanwhile, UI designers handled high-fidelity prototypes, visual design, interaction details, and served as the critical bridge between design and development teams.</p>
        <h3>Testing and Validation</h3>
            <h4>User Testing</h4>
              <p>Within the broader team of 20 B2E app designers, a core group of 5 senior designers were strategically selected to participate in usability sessions. These key team members played a critical role in soft launching new iterations and components, providing expert insights and validation during the design system's evolution.</p>
            <h4>Feedback Collection</h4>
              <p>The core 5-designer testing team would provide initial feedback before deploying to the weekly review with the full 20-designer team. </p>
            <h4>Iteration</h4>
              <p>We followed Agile methodology that breaks work into short, iterative cycles called sprints. It emphasizes collaboration, continuous feedback, and adaptability. Teams prioritize working solutions over extensive documentation, communicate frequently, and remain responsive to changing requirements. This approach allows for rapid iteration, quick problem-solving, and continuous improvement of the product or design system.</p>
        <h3>Final Solution</h3>
            <h4>Key screens</h4>
            <h4>Features and Functionality</h4>
              <p>To maintain brand alignment and technological efficiency, our design system focused on enhancing the core components by making them smaller, more compact, and feature-rich. The key objective was to create a more streamlined, adaptable system that could seamlessly integrate across different B2E applications while preserving the essential design language and functionality.</p>
            <h4>User Experience Improvements</h4>
              <p>The end usersâ€”our on-site employeesâ€”now saw their long-requested needs fulfilled, achieving the level of productivity they had been seeking. The design system's refined features directly addressed their workplace challenges, transforming their daily digital interactions into more efficient and intuitive experiences.</p>
        <h3>Outcome and Impact</h3>
            <h4>Quantitative Results</h4>
              <p>Figma analytics revealed a compelling story: fewer components were being detached, and usage was steadily increasing. This trend directly demonstrated the success of our user-centric approach, showing that by actively listening and responding to designers' needs, we created a more intuitive and adaptable design system.</p>
            <h4>Qualitative Feedback</h4>
              <p>The design system community was deeply engaged and passionate, feeling genuinely heard and valued. By adapting the system to meet designers' needs rather than forcing designers to conform, we fostered a collaborative environment that enhanced team dynamics and creativity. This approach transformed the design system from a mere tool to a collective, evolving framework that reflected the team's shared vision and expertise.</p>
            <h4>Business Impact</h4>
              <p>As the design system evolved, our relationship with end usersâ€”the bank employeesâ€”deepened significantly. They felt genuinely valued and invested in the process, enthusiastically participating in observation sessions and sharing their experiences. Their motivation to contribute insights became a collaborative partnership, transforming the design system from a top-down tool to a co-created solution that truly addressed their workplace needs.</p>
        <h3>Reflection and Learnings</h3>
            <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
              <p>The challenges were multifaceted: bridging legacy systems with misaligned technologies, integrating Figma Tokens, navigating budget constraints, and continuously evangelizing the design system internally. Each obstacle required strategic navigation and creative problem-solving to maintain momentum and adoption. I enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
            <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
              <p>The most profound lesson I learned is the critical importance of keeping users closely engaged and at the forefront of design decisions. Personal biases are a designer's greatest threat, potentially derailing objective solutions. By anchoring recommendations in concrete data, you create an irrefutable foundation that aligns teams, neutralizes subjective arguments, and ensures that the design truly serves its intended purpose. Facts become the universal language that cuts through individual perspectives and keeps everyone focused on the shared goal.</p>
            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
              <p>During these three challenging years of navigating complex design systems with diverse technologies, I developed a proven approach for tokens and scalable system deployment. This journey led me to create a unique pyramid for token namingâ€”a methodology I now recognize deserves broader attention. My hope is to eventually publish this approach, potentially helping other designers and design system architects facing similar challenges.</p>
