        <p>My journey to becoming the <mark>Seasoned Product Designer</mark> I am today has been like building a product roadmap, with each milestone unlocking a new feature. It started in <mark>Business & Marketing</mark>—think of it as the wireframe phase of my career, where I laid the foundation for the <mark>data-oriented UX designer</mark> I am today. Then I discovered <mark>Graphic Design</mark> and began shaping my ideas, one pixel at a time. Naturally, I leveled up to <mark>Web & Interactive Design</mark>, where I could finally get things movin'. Enter <mark>Figma and Design Systems</mark>—which sparked the geek in me and a newfound passion for tokens. As the insatiable dorky learner I am, I recently completed a <mark>Full Stack Web Development & AI</mark> certificate, because why stop at designing when you can code and optimize the whole product experience? Oh, and by the way, I fully coded this site—so I guess you could say I’m the full-stack designer... or a <mark>unicorn</mark>.</p>

    <h2>Desjardins B2E Design System</h2>
    <div class="case-study-content">
      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>A comprehensive design system tailored for Business-to-Employee (B2E) applications within the fintech sector. The design system serves as a centralized repository of standardized design components, guidelines, and principles, enabling consistent and efficient digital experiences across Desjardins' internal platforms.</p>
            <h4>Role and Responsibilities</h4>
              <p>As the Lead Designer, I was responsible for conceptualizing and developing the overarching design system strategy,
                  creating and maintaining design tokens, component libraries, documentation,
                  collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to ensure system-wide adoption,
                  driving design consistency and improving design efficiency and conducting design workshops and training sessions.</p>
            <h4>Project Timeline</h4>
              <p> Lead Designer for a 3-year duration</p>
            <h4>Team Structure</h4>
              <p>The design system comprised 20 hands-on B2E designers, with a core team of a Product Owner, Lead Designer (myself), UX Designer, UX Writer, and dedicated developers.</p>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <h4>Problem to Solve</h4>
            <p>The challenge was scaling from the Core Design System from customer-facing dot-com applications to B2E platforms, bridging technological differences between Adobe Experience Manager, web components, and Angular-based systems with distinct design needs.</p>
            <h4>Business Goals</h4>
            <p>Desjardins' business goals were fundamentally tied to optimizing application development and employee productivity. Given that a substantial portion of the company's revenues stems from interactions between customers and employees using these digital platforms, the design system became a critical strategic asset for operational efficiency and performance enhancement.</p>
            <h4>User Goals</h4>
            <p>From the user perspective, the primary goal was to enable employees to assist customers as seamlessly as possible, ultimately driving increased productivity and, consequently, sales. The design system needed to empower employees with intuitive, efficient tools that would reduce friction in their daily interactions and support high-quality customer service.</p>
        <h3>Research and Insights</h3>
            <h4>User Research</h4>
              <p>Conducted research at the Customer Relations Center (Centre de relations clients), providing direct opportunities to observe employees and perform usability testing. Desjardins' dedicated UX laboratory offered additional advanced research capabilities, enabling in-depth insights into employee interaction patterns and user experiences.</p>
            <h4>Persona</h4>
              <p>As a bank employee, one navigates a complex landscape of financial products and customer interactions. Day after day, the role demands moving between intricate computer systems, processing mortgages, evaluating loans, and providing personalized financial advice. This profession requires a keen eye for detail, the ability to quickly understand diverse financial situations, and the skill to seamlessly transition between multiple banking software platforms. More than just processing paperwork, the job is about being a financial guide, translating complex banking language into meaningful solutions for clients.</p>
            <h4>Key insights</h4>
              <p>Employees emerged as sophisticated "power users" who simultaneously navigated complex applications with remarkable agility. The design priorities centered on maximizing operational efficiency, reducing cognitive load, and streamlining task completion. Critical to success was an intuitive, high-performance user interface that supported rapid context-switching and minimized potential for error, ultimately enhancing overall workplace productivity</p>
        <h3>Ideation and Strategy</h3>
            <h4>Brainstorming and Ideation</h4>
              <p>Design alignment was achieved through weekly design reviews, where B2E designer teams collaborated to synchronize application approaches. Additionally, a weekly Design System Review meeting allowed teams to present ongoing sprint tasks and gather collective insights on component evolution and design system development and improvement</p>
            <h4>Design Principles</h4>
              <p>Design decisions were driven by a design thinking approach and user-centric methodologies. By leveraging Figma data analytics and user research insights, the team ensured a data-driven strategy for design system development, prioritizing empirical evidence and user experience in every design choice.</p>
        <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <h4>Wireframes and Prototyping</h4>
              <p>UX and UI designers collaborated in paired teams, with distinct yet complementary responsibilities. The UX designers focused on research, low-fidelity wireframes, storyboards, and initial prototypes to define the overall structural approach and documentation.</p>
            <h4>Visual & UI Design</h4>
              <p>Meanwhile, UI designers handled high-fidelity prototypes, visual design, interaction details, and served as the critical bridge between design and development teams.</p>
