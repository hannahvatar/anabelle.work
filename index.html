        <p>My journey to becoming the <span class="highlight-pink">Seasoned Product Designer</span> I am today has been like building a product roadmap, with each milestone unlocking a new feature. It started in <span class="highlight-red">Business & Marketing</span>â€”think of it as the wireframe phase of my career, where I laid the foundation for the <span class="highlight-blue">data-oriented UX designer</span> I am today. Then I discovered <span class="highlight-orange">Graphic Design</span> and began shaping my ideas, one pixel at a time. Naturally, I leveled up to <span class="highlight-yellow">Web & Interactive Design</span>, where I could finally get things movin'. Enter <span class="highlight-green">Figma and Design Systems</span>â€”which sparked the geek in me and a newfound passion for tokens. As the insatiable dorky learner I am, I recently completed a <span class="highlight-violet">Full Stack Web Development & AI</span> certificate, because why stop at designing when you can code and optimize the whole product experience? Oh, and by the way, I fully coded this siteâ€”so I guess you could say Iâ€™m the full-stack designer... or a <strong>unicorn</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Grrunch App</h2>
      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Grrunch is an innovative web application designed to help consumers make smarter, more cost-effective grocery shopping decisions. By leveraging web scraping technology, the app continuously monitors and tracks prices of grocery items across multiple stores. It empowers customers with real-time price intelligence, automatically tracking price fluctuations, sending alerts when products hit their lowest recorded price, and providing historical price data. </p>
           <h4>Role and Responsibilities</h4>
            <p>Founder & CEO</p>
           <h4>Project Timeline</h4>
            <p>I created Grrunch in early 2023.</p>
           <h4>Team Structure</h4>
            <p>I launched the project by hiring two developers to conduct an initial proof of concept to test web scraping feasibility. Once validated, I then brought in a technology lawyer to validate the legal implications of my approach. Subsequently, I coded with two developers the MVP, while taking leadership of the UX/UI design.</p>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <h4>Problem To Solve</h4>
            <p>The price of the grocery basket has skyrocketed. It is nearly impossible for consumers, even the most educated ones, to navigate online marketing strategies like dynamic pricing, SEM algorithms with cross-selling intentions, or broad match keyword targeting. Similarly, on-site marketing tactics such as loss leaders and shrinkflation make it equally challenging to make informed purchasing decisions.</p>
          <h4>Business Goals</h4>
            <p>Through its technology, the Grrunch app creates value by providing price insights, enabling the development of a primary membership-based application to monetize scraped data. Additional revenue models will be introduced, such as delivery services with associated fees.</p>
          <h4>User Goals</h4>
            <p>The userâ€™s goal is to be empowered with a tool that has never existed beforeâ€”forget coupons and flyers. Grrunch provides real insights to help consumers make informed decisions. The core of the platform remains democratic, offering a free version that makes the information accessible and helps people reduce their grocery bills.</p>
        <h3>Research and Insights</h3>
          <h4>User Research</h4>
            <p>You donâ€™t need extensive user research to recognize that more and more people are struggling to afford groceries. Itâ€™s in the news every day. According to Statistics Canada, grocery prices have risen significantly since 2020, with food prices increasing by approximately 21-25% from 2020 to 2023. Meanwhile, requests for food bank assistance are breaking records.</p>
          <h4>Persona</h4>
            <p>A price-sensitive grocery shopper struggles with rising food costs while trying to make the most of a limited budget. They shop at discount stores, rely on coupons, and often compare prices across multiple retailers to find the best deals. Overwhelmed by deceptive marketing tactics and the lack of a centralized tool for price comparison, they need a simple solution that provides real-time price insights, tracks price fluctuations, and alerts them to discounts.</p>
          <h4>Key insights</h4>
            <p>After conducting several focus groups, I discovered a key insight: the app addresses a problem that many people don't even realize they have. When I show them how beneficial Grrunch is and the value of the data it provides, their reactions are nothing short of amazed. The biggest challenge before driving sales will be educating consumers that coupons and flyers for example are not real solutions for saving money.</p>
        <h3>Ideation and Strategy</h3>
          <h4>Brainstorming and Ideation</h4>
            <p>I was going through my usual Saturday ritual of sorting through coupons and flyers, trying to find the real deals and make smart choices. I'm also a member of an online coupon community. Suddenly, it hit me: these women (myself included) are spending what could amount to a full-time job just to save a few pennies. That's when it clickedâ€”there has to be a way to automate this process. And that's how Grrunch was born.</p>
          <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
            <p>This is the initial iteration of the information architecture, considering revenue models, premium features, and other key features</p>
          <h4>Design Principles</h4>
            <p>Among the design principles, scalability and flexibility are crucial, as this app is technology-driven and has international potential. However, it needs to be deployed locally first, with the plan to scale the model gradually. Performance and accessibility are also key considerations: the app will be desktop-based and must be compatible with legacy browsers, as the target users may not have the latest smartphones or reliable internet connections at home.</p>
        <h3>Testing and Validation</h3>
          <h4>User Testing</h4>
            <p>User testing was conducted in two stages: the initial proof of concept (POC) aimed to confirm whether the technology approach would work and deliver the expected data. Once this was validated, I, alongside two other developers, built the first MVP, expanding the technology to sample products by scraping data from three specific grocery stores. The tests were conclusive.</p>
          <h4>Feedback Collection</h4>
            <p>A lot of feedback was collected, with some key insights. The main challenge, though feasible, was scraping JavaScript-based sites (SPAs), as well as the risk of getting detected by sending pings to the sites twice a day. To mitigate this, we would need to adjust the approach by tracking URLs instead. Additionally, there is a need to find a way to automate the database building process, as each grocery store typically contains around 50,000 products.</p>
          <h4>Iteration</h4>
            <p>Apart from the technology approach that still requires refinement, the entire UX/UI design has been reconsidered to be more educational, addressing the insight that we are solving a problem many people donâ€™t realize they have. A separate marketing site could also be developed to raise awareness.</p>
        <h3>Final Solution</h3>
          <h4>Key Screens and Flows</h4>
          <h4>Features and Functionality</h4>
            <p>The key feature for the user is access to each product in the grocery store inventory through our database. The product page displays essential information such as price trends (highest, lowest, and average). Users can then reorganize the data by store, brand, or, most importantly, by price per weight. Membership features would include additional services like delivery options, menu planning, price alerts, the ability to save favorite items, and more.</p>
          <h4>User Experience Improvements</h4>
            <p>The real benefit of this platform, compared to any other online shopping experience (or even in-store), is access to unbiased, data-driven insights. Unlike traditional methods where prices and promotions are influenced by marketing tactics, this platform provides transparent price trends, product comparisons, and detailed information that help consumers make informed purchasing decisions, free from external influence.</p>
        <h3>Outcome and Impact</h3>
          <h4>Quantitative Results</h4>
            <p>I am thrilled to share these remarkable quantitative findings from grrunch.com. Looking at just three everyday products - orange juice, vanilla ice cream, and toilet paper - reveals significant potential savings. Comparing similar quality products shows striking price variations: No Name Orange Juice with Pulp from Provigo (0.17$/100ml) versus Simply Pulp Free Orange Juice from Loblaws (0.45$/100ml) demonstrates a 164.71% increase. For vanilla ice cream, Breyers Natural Vanilla from Loblaws (0.27$/100ml) compared to PC Black Label Madagascar Vanilla (0.80$/100ml) represents a 196.30% increase. In toilet paper, PC Max Soft 12 Double Rolls from Maxi (0.58$/roll) versus Ultra Soft 12=48 Rolls (224 tissues/roll) from Maxi (1.58$/roll) shows a 172.41% increase. These differences range from 164.71% to 196.30% among comparable products. Consumers who consistently choose the lowest-priced options would spend only 37.7% to 50.8% of what they would pay for premium alternatives - proof of the substantial savings possible through grrunch.com's technology.</p>
          <h4>Qualitative Feedback</h4>
            <p>Many initially dismiss grrunch.com by comparing it to coupon aggregators like Flipp.com or GoCoupons.com, suggesting the market is saturated. However, once educated about grocery marketing strategies and shown grrunch's actual capabilities, their skepticism transforms into enthusiasm, with users eager for the product's release. The stark shift from initial hesitation to strong interest demonstrates that while the value proposition requires some explanation, the product's unique benefits are immediately apparent once understood.</p>
          <h4>Business Impact</h4>
            <p>The core challenge lies in helping consumers recognize a problem they haven't yet acknowledged. The MVP's quantitative results strongly validate grrunch's mission. Beyond just helping people afford food, this app has the potential to transform grocery retail models and marketing approaches, ultimately working toward food accessibility outside traditional capitalist frameworks.</p>
        <h3>Reflection and Learnings</h3>
          <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
            <p>Three key challenges shape grrunch's development: refining a sustainable web scraping model, building a comprehensive product database, and overcoming consumer unawareness of marketing tactics that impact grocery affordability. While significant, these obstacles are surmountable through continuous technological improvement and consumer education.</p>
          <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
            <p>The key learning has been to prioritize user perspective over my expertise in marketing. Despite my conviction in grrunch's potential impact on grocery affordability, success requires viewing the problem through the everyday shopper's lens. Only by developing the solution alongside users can we achieve the goal of making food more affordable.</p>
          <h4>Next steps</h4>
            <p>With a proven MVP demonstrating technological feasibility and legal support secured, the path forward is clear: finalize the business plan and pursue venture capital funding. The mission of universal food accessibility awaits its next champions among forward-thinking investors.</p>

      <h2>Desjardins B2E Design System</h2>
      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>A comprehensive design system tailored for Business-to-Employee (B2E) applications within the fintech sector. The design system serves as a centralized repository of standardized design components, guidelines, and principles, enabling consistent and efficient digital experiences across Desjardins' internal platforms.</p>
            <h4>Role and Responsibilities</h4>
              <p>As the Lead Designer, I was responsible for conceptualizing and developing the overarching design system strategy,
                  creating and maintaining design tokens, component libraries, documentation,
                  collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to ensure system-wide adoption,
                  driving design consistency and improving design efficiency and conducting design workshops and training sessions.</p>
            <h4>Project Timeline</h4>
              <p> Lead Designer for a 3-year duration</p>
            <h4>Team Structure</h4>
              <p>The design system comprised 20 hands-on B2E designers, with a core team of a Product Owner, Lead Designer (myself), UX Designer, UX Writer, and dedicated developers.</p>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <h4>Problem to Solve</h4>
            <p>The challenge was scaling from the Core Design System from customer-facing dot-com applications to B2E platforms, bridging technological differences between Adobe Experience Manager, web components, and Angular-based systems with distinct design needs.</p>
            <h4>Business Goals</h4>
            <p>Desjardins' business goals were fundamentally tied to optimizing application development and employee productivity. Given that a substantial portion of the company's revenues stems from interactions between customers and employees using these digital platforms, the design system became a critical strategic asset for operational efficiency and performance enhancement.</p>
            <h4>User Goals</h4>
            <p>From the user perspective, the primary goal was to enable employees to assist customers as seamlessly as possible, ultimately driving increased productivity and, consequently, sales. The design system needed to empower employees with intuitive, efficient tools that would reduce friction in their daily interactions and support high-quality customer service.</p>
        <h3>Research and Insights</h3>
            <h4>User Research</h4>
              <p>Conducted research at the Customer Relations Center (Centre de relations clients), providing direct opportunities to observe employees and perform usability testing. Desjardins' dedicated UX laboratory offered additional advanced research capabilities, enabling in-depth insights into employee interaction patterns and user experiences.</p>
            <h4>Persona</h4>
              <p>As a bank employee, one navigates a complex landscape of financial products and customer interactions. Day after day, the role demands moving between intricate computer systems, processing mortgages, evaluating loans, and providing personalized financial advice. This profession requires a keen eye for detail, the ability to quickly understand diverse financial situations, and the skill to seamlessly transition between multiple banking software platforms. More than just processing paperwork, the job is about being a financial guide, translating complex banking language into meaningful solutions for clients.</p>
            <h4>Key insights</h4>
              <p>Employees emerged as sophisticated "power users" who simultaneously navigated complex applications with remarkable agility. The design priorities centered on maximizing operational efficiency, reducing cognitive load, and streamlining task completion. Critical to success was an intuitive, high-performance user interface that supported rapid context-switching and minimized potential for error, ultimately enhancing overall workplace productivity</p>
        <h3>Ideation and Strategy</h3>
            <h4>Brainstorming and Ideation</h4>
              <p>Design alignment was achieved through weekly design reviews, where B2E designer teams collaborated to synchronize application approaches. Additionally, a weekly Design System Review meeting allowed teams to present ongoing sprint tasks and gather collective insights on component evolution and design system development and improvement</p>
            <h4>Design Principles</h4>
              <p>Design decisions were driven by a design thinking approach and user-centric methodologies. By leveraging Figma data analytics and user research insights, the team ensured a data-driven strategy for design system development, prioritizing empirical evidence and user experience in every design choice.</p>
        <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <h4>Wireframes and Prototyping</h4>
              <p>UX and UI designers collaborated in paired teams, with distinct yet complementary responsibilities. The UX designers focused on research, low-fidelity wireframes, storyboards, and initial prototypes to define the overall structural approach and documentation.</p>
            <h4>Visual & UI Design</h4>
              <p>Meanwhile, UI designers handled high-fidelity prototypes, visual design, interaction details, and served as the critical bridge between design and development teams.</p>
        <h3>Testing and Validation</h3>
            <h4>User Testing</h4>
              <p>Within the broader team of 20 B2E app designers, a core group of 5 senior designers were strategically selected to participate in usability sessions. These key team members played a critical role in soft launching new iterations and components, providing expert insights and validation during the design system's evolution.</p>
            <h4>Feedback Collection</h4>
              <p>The core 5-designer testing team would provide initial feedback before deploying to the weekly review with the full 20-designer team. </p>
            <h4>Iteration</h4>
              <p>We followed Agile methodology that breaks work into short, iterative cycles called sprints. It emphasizes collaboration, continuous feedback, and adaptability. Teams prioritize working solutions over extensive documentation, communicate frequently, and remain responsive to changing requirements. This approach allows for rapid iteration, quick problem-solving, and continuous improvement of the product or design system.</p>
        <h3>Final Solution</h3>
            <h4>Key screens</h4>
            <h4>Features and Functionality</h4>
              <p>To maintain brand alignment and technological efficiency, our design system focused on enhancing the core components by making them smaller, more compact, and feature-rich. The key objective was to create a more streamlined, adaptable system that could seamlessly integrate across different B2E applications while preserving the essential design language and functionality.</p>
            <h4>User Experience Improvements</h4>
              <p>The end usersâ€”our on-site employeesâ€”now saw their long-requested needs fulfilled, achieving the level of productivity they had been seeking. The design system's refined features directly addressed their workplace challenges, transforming their daily digital interactions into more efficient and intuitive experiences.</p>
        <h3>Outcome and Impact</h3>
            <h4>Quantitative Results</h4>
              <p>Figma analytics revealed a compelling story: fewer components were being detached, and usage was steadily increasing. This trend directly demonstrated the success of our user-centric approach, showing that by actively listening and responding to designers' needs, we created a more intuitive and adaptable design system.</p>
            <h4>Qualitative Feedback</h4>
              <p>The design system community was deeply engaged and passionate, feeling genuinely heard and valued. By adapting the system to meet designers' needs rather than forcing designers to conform, we fostered a collaborative environment that enhanced team dynamics and creativity. This approach transformed the design system from a mere tool to a collective, evolving framework that reflected the team's shared vision and expertise.</p>
            <h4>Business Impact</h4>
              <p>As the design system evolved, our relationship with end usersâ€”the bank employeesâ€”deepened significantly. They felt genuinely valued and invested in the process, enthusiastically participating in observation sessions and sharing their experiences. Their motivation to contribute insights became a collaborative partnership, transforming the design system from a top-down tool to a co-created solution that truly addressed their workplace needs.</p>
        <h3>Reflection and Learnings</h3>
            <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
              <p>The challenges were multifaceted: bridging legacy systems with misaligned technologies, integrating Figma Tokens, navigating budget constraints, and continuously evangelizing the design system internally. Each obstacle required strategic navigation and creative problem-solving to maintain momentum and adoption. I enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
            <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
              <p>The most profound lesson I learned is the critical importance of keeping users closely engaged and at the forefront of design decisions. Personal biases are a designer's greatest threat, potentially derailing objective solutions. By anchoring recommendations in concrete data, you create an irrefutable foundation that aligns teams, neutralizes subjective arguments, and ensures that the design truly serves its intended purpose. Facts become the universal language that cuts through individual perspectives and keeps everyone focused on the shared goal.</p>
            <h4>Next Steps</h4>
              <p>During these three challenging years of navigating complex design systems with diverse technologies, I developed a proven approach for tokens and scalable system deployment. This journey led me to create a unique pyramid for token namingâ€”a methodology I now recognize deserves broader attention. My hope is to eventually publish this approach, potentially helping other designers and design system architects facing similar challenges.</p>
