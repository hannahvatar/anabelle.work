        <h2>Reflection and Learnings</h2>
            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
              <p>The challenges were multifaceted: bridging legacy systems with misaligned technologies, integrating Figma Tokens, navigating budget constraints, and continuously evangelizing the design system internally. Each obstacle required strategic navigation and creative problem-solving to maintain momentum and adoption. I enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
              <p>The most profound lesson I learned is the critical importance of keeping users closely engaged and at the forefront of design decisions. Personal biases are a designer's greatest threat, potentially derailing objective solutions. By anchoring recommendations in concrete data, you create an irrefutable foundation that aligns teams, neutralizes subjective arguments, and ensures that the design truly serves its intended purpose. Facts become the universal language that cuts through individual perspectives and keeps everyone focused on the shared goal.</p>
            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
              <p>During these three challenging years of navigating complex design systems with diverse technologies, I developed a proven approach for tokens and scalable system deployment. This journey led me to create a unique pyramid for token naming—a methodology I now recognize deserves broader attention. My hope is to eventually publish this approach, potentially helping other designers and design system architects facing similar challenges.</p>
