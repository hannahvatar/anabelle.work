            <h2>Reflection and Learnings</h2>
        <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
          <p>The challenge I faced during those 5 years was to merge an American brand with our French Canadian culture. The cultural codes were different, but I enjoyed every moment trying to creatively adapt the concept to make it truly our own.</p>
        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <p>I enjoyed working for Turo because they were early adopters in many ways. I had the chance to get on the Figma bandwagon much earlier than in Quebec, which gave me many opportunities. Also, their high expectations for design made me up my game, and I improved a lot during my time there</p>
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          <p>I still carry that experience with me and implement the way they structured work, design, and brand guidelines. They were clearly a model to me, and I am trying to make others benefit from my experience over there.</p>
