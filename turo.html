    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <h4>Problem To Solve</h4>
          <p>Turo solves two key problems: it helps car owners earn money from their vehicles when they're not using them, while giving renters more affordable and diverse vehicle options compared to traditional rental companies.</p>

        <h4>User Goals</h4>
          <p>Turo's two user segments have distinct goals: Hosts aim to generate passive income by safely sharing their vehicles and managing rentals efficiently, while Guests seek convenient access to a diverse selection of vehicles at competitive prices with a smooth booking and rental experience.</p>
     <h3>Research and Insights</h3>
        <h4>User Research</h4>
