            <h3>Role and Responsibilities</h3>
              <p>Founder & CEO</p>
             <h3>Project Timeline</h3>
              <p>I created Grrunch in early 2023.</p>
             <h3>Team Structure</h3>
              <p>I launched the project by hiring two developers to conduct an initial proof of concept to test web scraping feasibility. Once validated, I then brought in a technology lawyer to validate the legal implications of my approach. Subsequently, I coded with two developers the MVP, while taking leadership of the UX/UI design.</p>
          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <h3>Problem To Solve</h3>
              <p>The price of the grocery basket has skyrocketed. It is nearly impossible for consumers, even the most educated ones, to navigate online marketing strategies like dynamic pricing, SEM algorithms with cross-selling intentions, or broad match keyword targeting. Similarly, on-site marketing tactics such as loss leaders and shrinkflation make it equally challenging to make informed purchasing decisions.</p>
            <h3>Business Goals</h3>
              <p>Through its technology, the Grrunch app creates value by providing price insights, enabling the development of a primary membership-based application to monetize scraped data. Additional revenue models will be introduced, such as delivery services with associated fees.</p>
            <h3>User Goals</h3>
              <p>The user’s goal is to be empowered with a tool that has never existed before—forget coupons and flyers. Grrunch provides real insights to help consumers make informed decisions. The core of the platform remains democratic, offering a free version that makes the information accessible and helps people reduce their grocery bills.</p>
          <h2>Research and Insights</h2>
            <h3>User Research</h3>
              <p>You don’t need extensive user research to recognize that more and more people are struggling to afford groceries. It’s in the news every day. According to Statistics Canada, grocery prices have risen significantly since 2020, with food prices increasing by approximately 21-25% from 2020 to 2023. Meanwhile, requests for food bank assistance are breaking records.</p>
            <h3>Persona</h3>
              <p>A price-sensitive grocery shopper struggles with rising food costs while trying to make the most of a limited budget. They shop at discount stores, rely on coupons, and often compare prices across multiple retailers to find the best deals. Overwhelmed by deceptive marketing tactics and the lack of a centralized tool for price comparison, they need a simple solution that provides real-time price insights, tracks price fluctuations, and alerts them to discounts.</p>
            <h3>Key insights</h3>
              <p>After conducting several focus groups, I discovered a key insight: the app addresses a problem that many people don't even realize they have. When I show them how beneficial Grrunch is and the value of the data it provides, their reactions are nothing short of amazed. The biggest challenge before driving sales will be educating consumers that coupons and flyers for example are not real solutions for saving money.</p>
          <h2>Ideation and Strategy</h2>
            <h3>Brainstorming and Ideation</h3>
              <p>I was going through my usual Saturday ritual of sorting through coupons and flyers, trying to find the real deals and make smart choices. I'm also a member of an online coupon community. Suddenly, it hit me: these women (myself included) are spending what could amount to a full-time job just to save a few pennies. That's when it clicked—there has to be a way to automate this process. And that's how Grrunch was born.</p>
            <h3>Information Architecture & Main flows</h3>
              <p>While the complete information architecture will encompass extensive features including sign-up, membership levels, favorites, shopping lists, and cart functionality, the MVP focused on one essential user flows: product search and sorting capabilities.</p>

            <h3>Design Principles</h3>
              <p>Among the design principles, scalability and flexibility are crucial, as this app is technology-driven and has international potential. However, it needs to be deployed locally first, with the plan to scale the model gradually. Performance and accessibility are also key considerations: the app will be desktop-based and must be compatible with legacy browsers, as the target users may not have the latest smartphones or reliable internet connections at home.</p>

         <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <h3>Wireframes</h3>
          <h3>Visual Design</h3>
          <h3>Component Design</h3>



              <h2>Testing and Validation</h2>
            <h3>User Testing</h3>
              <p>User testing was conducted in two stages: the initial proof of concept (POC) aimed to confirm whether the technology approach would work and deliver the expected data. Once this was validated, I, alongside two other developers, built the first MVP, expanding the technology to sample products by scraping data from three specific grocery stores. The tests were conclusive.</p>
            <h3>Feedback Collection</h3>
              <p>A lot of feedback was collected, with some key insights. The main challenge, though feasible, was scraping JavaScript-based sites (SPAs), as well as the risk of getting detected by sending pings to the sites twice a day. To mitigate this, we would need to adjust the approach by tracking URLs instead. Additionally, there is a need to find a way to automate the database building process, as each grocery store typically contains around 50,000 products.</p>
            <h3>Iteration</h3>
              <p>Apart from the technology approach that still requires refinement, the entire UX/UI design has been reconsidered to be more educational, addressing the insight that we are solving a problem many people don’t realize they have. A separate marketing site could also be developed to raise awareness.</p>
          <h2>Final Solution</h2>
            <h3>Key Screens and Flows</h3>
              <h4>Product Search: Real-time price comparison across multiple retailers</h4>

            <h3>Features and Functionality</h3>
              <p>The key feature for the user is access to each product in the grocery store inventory through our database. The product page displays essential information such as price trends (highest, lowest, and average). Users can then reorganize the data by store, brand, or, most importantly, by price per weight. Membership features would include additional services like delivery options, menu planning, price alerts, the ability to save favorite items, and more.</p>
            <h3>User Experience Improvements</h3>
              <p>The real benefit of this platform, compared to any other online shopping experience (or even in-store), is access to unbiased, data-driven insights. Unlike traditional methods where prices and promotions are influenced by marketing tactics, this platform provides transparent price trends, product comparisons, and detailed information that help consumers make informed purchasing decisions, free from external influence.</p>
          <h2>Outcome and Impact</h2>
            <h3>Quantitative Results</h3>
              <p>I am thrilled to share these remarkable quantitative findings from grrunch.com. Looking at just three everyday products - orange juice, vanilla ice cream, and toilet paper - reveals significant potential savings. Comparing similar quality products shows striking price variations: No Name Orange Juice with Pulp from Provigo (0.17$/100ml) versus Simply Pulp Free Orange Juice from Loblaws (0.45$/100ml) demonstrates a 164.71% increase. For vanilla ice cream, Breyers Natural Vanilla from Loblaws (0.27$/100ml) compared to PC Black Label Madagascar Vanilla (0.80$/100ml) represents a 196.30% increase. In toilet paper, PC Max Soft 12 Double Rolls from Maxi (0.58$/roll) versus Ultra Soft 12=48 Rolls (224 tissues/roll) from Maxi (1.58$/roll) shows a 172.41% increase. These differences range from 164.71% to 196.30% among comparable products. Consumers who consistently choose the lowest-priced options would spend only 37.7% to 50.8% of what they would pay for premium alternatives - proof of the substantial savings possible through grrunch.com's technology.</p>
            <h3>Qualitative Feedback</h3>
              <p>Many initially dismiss grrunch.com by comparing it to coupon aggregators like Flipp.com or GoCoupons.com, suggesting the market is saturated. However, once educated about grocery marketing strategies and shown grrunch's actual capabilities, their skepticism transforms into enthusiasm, with users eager for the product's release. The stark shift from initial hesitation to strong interest demonstrates that while the value proposition requires some explanation, the product's unique benefits are immediately apparent once understood.</p>
            <h3>Business Impact</h3>
              <p>The core challenge lies in helping consumers recognize a problem they haven't yet acknowledged. The MVP's quantitative results strongly validate grrunch's mission. Beyond just helping people afford food, this app has the potential to transform grocery retail models and marketing approaches, ultimately working toward food accessibility outside traditional capitalist frameworks.</p>
          <h2>Reflection and Learnings</h2>
            <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
              <p>Three key challenges shape grrunch's development: refining a sustainable web scraping model, building a comprehensive product database, and overcoming consumer unawareness of marketing tactics that impact grocery affordability. While significant, these obstacles are surmountable through continuous technological improvement and consumer education.</p>
            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
              <p>The key learning has been to prioritize user perspective over my expertise in marketing. Despite my conviction in grrunch's potential impact on grocery affordability, success requires viewing the problem through the everyday shopper's lens. Only by developing the solution alongside users can we achieve the goal of making food more affordable.</p>
            <h3>Next steps</h3>
              <p>With a proven MVP demonstrating technological feasibility and legal support secured, the path forward is clear: finalize the business plan and pursue venture capital funding. The mission of universal food accessibility awaits its next champions among forward-thinking investors.</p>
